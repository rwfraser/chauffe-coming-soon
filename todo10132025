ERROR CHECKING AND TESTING:
First Name/Last Name management.  Required to purchase DLO licences - duplicate name handling?  

- DLOIDs must be unique and have an ACCURATE 1:1 relationship with User Account first name/last name combinations, therefore web site should generate a UUID for each user which is incorporated into each of their blockchains and Controllers.   COMPLETE

- add first name and last name fields to profile.  User name will continue to be email address.  First and last names must be present before a controller licence purchase may be completed.  COMPLETE 10/13/25
 
 CLOUD MANAGER STRUCTURE REVIEW
 - must incorporate the website account UUID for irrefutable evicence of valid licence for each specific Controller.

 - must incorporate the DLOID parameter fields

 - must avoid duplicates and/or invalid entries especially in the Rating and ControllerID numbering fields - i.e. Existing Licences field.  These fields should be populated automatically now that the UUID is available to retrieve all known controller information from CloudManager.py.  Therefore these fields will be prepopulated with a read only value representing the next highest available.

 - Existing Licences field - meant to set the continuous count of Controllers.  Only in exceptional circumstances (i.e. early adopters) will these be other than 0.  i.e. current licensee has no previous licences.  This will be the norm for at least the first 10,000 controllers other than closely held early adopters totalling 9110 Controllers, distributed amoung 15 individual investors.  
 - Indiegogo supporters (and Employee and Vendor Licensees) will share Controller Licensing privileges (Indiegogo Licences will be operated by the GP on behalf of Indiegogo supporters).  Transactions on these specific blockchains will record their supporting interests and any privileges which may accrue.  No privileges will initially be granted EXCEPT Convertibility upon initial issuance.
